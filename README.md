# Overloads in JavaScript

Allows you to make arbitrary overloads of functions. 
That particular implementation and various additions to the thing (that made it look, behave and work better) are all mine.  
The idea occured to me from that Ru Habr post: https://habr.com/ru/post/86403/

## Files 

For examples go to the src/examples.js file. 
The implementation is contained in src/polymorph.js file.
