New list of TODOS; 

1. Fix comments and docs; Stress that it is for adding RUNTIME types to the thing 
2. Add compatibility with the "math-expressions.js@>=1.0": let this thing also use the infinite types, along with the non-infinite ones and so on... 

	Simplify the already written code using one's 'idea-driven' approach...
	Also, the other libraries (create new functions for new releases from the tasks that are common here...; then, substitute-refactor, make dependencies...); 

3. Create more interesting classes, modules; Add more stuff generally to the library...
4. (Suggestion?) Add the 'globalvars' and 'localvars' exports (and also (especially as they had not yet been exported...), make them (and their sub-maps) InfiniteMaps...)

5. Publish the 1.2 version after having finished these todos...
6. Debug it properly (there are bugs...)

7. Work on documentation...

8. LATER: 

	Delete this...
	The 'math-expression.js@>=1.1' will be implementing the functionality of this FAR-FAR more extendedly...;
